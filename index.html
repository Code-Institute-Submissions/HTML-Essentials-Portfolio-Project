                    <h3>The World's Oldest Megolithic Structure?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Six miles from Urfa, an ancient city in southeastern Turkey, Klaus Schmidt has made one of the
                        most
                        startling
                        archaeological discoveries of our time: massive carved stones about 11,000 years old, crafted
                        and
                        arranged
                        by
                        prehistoric people who had not yet developed metal tools or even pottery. The megaliths predate
                        Stonehenge
                        by
                        some 6,000 years. The place is called Gobekli Tepe, and Schmidt, a German archaeologist who has
                        been
                        working
                        here more than a decade, is convinced it's the site of the world's oldest temple.

                            Distinctive T-shaped pillars are carved with images of wild animals,
                            providing
                            insight into the way of life and beliefs of people living in Upper Mesopotamia about 11,500
                            years
                            ago.

                            The monuments were probably used in connection with social events and rituals
                            and
                            feature
                            distinctive limestone T-shaped pillars, some of which are up to 5.50 meters tall. Some of
                            the
                            pillars,
                            which are abstract depictions of the human form, also feature low reliefs of items of
                            clothing, e.g.
                            belts and loincloths, as well as high and low reliefs of wild animals.
