                <h3>The World's Oldest Megolithic Structure?</h3>

                <p>
                    Six miles from Urfa, an ancient city in southeastern Turkey, Klaus Schmidt has made one of the most
                    startling
                    archaeological discoveries of our time: massive carved stones about 11,000 years old, crafted and
                    arranged
                    by
                    prehistoric people who had not yet developed metal tools or even pottery. The megaliths predate
                    Stonehenge
                    by
                    some 6,000 years. The place is called Gobekli Tepe, and Schmidt, a German archaeologist who has been
                    working
                    here more than a decade, is convinced it's the site of the world's oldest temple.

                    Located in the Germuş mountains of south-eastern Anatolia, this property presents monumental
                    round-oval
                    and rectangular megalithic structures erected by hunter-gatherers in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic age
                    between 9,600 and 8,200 BCE. These monuments were probably used in connection with rituals, most
                    likely
                    of a funerary nature. Distinctive T-shaped pillars are carved with images of wild animals, providing
                    insight into the way of life and beliefs of people living in Upper Mesopotamia about 11,500 years
                    ago.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Göbekli Tepe is located in Upper Mesopotamia, a region which saw the emergence of the most ancient
                    farming communities in the world. Monumental structures, interpreted as monumental communal
                    buildings
                    (enclosures), were erected by groups of hunter-gatherers in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period
                    (10th-9th
                    millennia BC). The monuments were probably used in connection with social events and rituals and
                    feature
                    distinctive limestone T-shaped pillars, some of which are up to 5.50 meters tall. Some of the
                    pillars,
                    which are abstract depictions of the human form, also feature low reliefs of items of clothing, e.g.
                    belts and loincloths, as well as high and low reliefs of wild animals. Recent excavation works have
                    also
                    identified the remains of non-monumental structures which appear to stem from domestic buildings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Criterion (i): The communities that built the monumental megalithic structures of Göbekli Tepe lived
                    during one of the most momentous transitions in human history, one which took us from
                    hunter-gatherer
                    lifeways to the first farming communities. The monumental buildings at Göbekli Tepe demonstrate the
                    creative human genius of these early (Pre-Pottery Neolithic) societies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Criterion (ii): Göbekli Tepe is one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental
                    architecture.
                    The site testifies to innovative building techniques, including the integration of frequently
                    decorated
                    T-shaped limestone pillars, which also fulfilled architectural functions. The imagery found at
                    Göbekli
                    Tepe, adorning T-pillars and some small finds (stone vessels, shaft-straighteners, etc.), is also
                    found
                    at contemporaneous sites in the Upper Mesopotamian region, thus testifying to a close social network
                    in
                    this core region of Neolithisation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Criterion (iv): Göbekli Tepe is an outstanding example of a monumental ensemble of monumental
                    megalithic
                    structures illustrating a significant period of human history. The monolithic T-shaped pillars were
                    carved from the adjacent limestone plateau and attest to new levels of architectural and engineering
                    technology. They are believed to bear witness to the presence of specialized craftsmen, and possibly
                    the
                    emergence of more hierarchical forms of human society.
