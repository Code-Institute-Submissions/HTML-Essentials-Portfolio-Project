    <h1>The World's Oldest Megolithic Structure?</h1>

            Six miles from Urfa, an ancient city in southeastern Turkey, Klaus Schmidt has made one of the most
            startling
            archaeological discoveries of our time: massive carved stones about 11,000 years old, crafted and arranged
            by
            prehistoric people who had not yet developed metal tools or even pottery. The megaliths predate Stonehenge
            by
            some 6,000 years. The place is called Gobekli Tepe, and Schmidt, a German archaeologist who has been working
            here more than a decade, is convinced it's the site of the world's oldest temple.
