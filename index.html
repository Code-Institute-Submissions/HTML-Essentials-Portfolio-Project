                <h3>The World's Oldest Megolithic Structure?</h3>

                <p>
                    Six miles from Urfa, an ancient city in southeastern Turkey, Klaus Schmidt has made one of the most
                    startling
                    archaeological discoveries of our time: massive carved stones about 11,000 years old, crafted and
                    arranged
                    by
                    prehistoric people who had not yet developed metal tools or even pottery. The megaliths predate
                    Stonehenge
                    by
                    some 6,000 years. The place is called Gobekli Tepe, and Schmidt, a German archaeologist who has been
                    working
                    here more than a decade, is convinced it's the site of the world's oldest temple.

                Göbekli Tepe is located in Upper Mesopotamia, a region which saw the emergence of the most ancient
                farming communities in the world. Monumental structures, interpreted as monumental communal buildings
                (enclosures), were erected by groups of hunter-gatherers in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period (10th-9th
                millennia BC). The monuments were probably used in connection with social events and rituals and feature
                distinctive limestone T-shaped pillars, some of which are up to 5.50 meters tall. Some of the pillars,
                which are abstract depictions of the human form, also feature low reliefs of items of clothing, e.g.
                belts and loincloths, as well as high and low reliefs of wild animals. Recent excavation works have also
                identified the remains of non-monumental structures which appear to stem from domestic buildings.
