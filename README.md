## Features 

Below is a detailed explanantion of the various features built into the website, along with some additonal features that could be implemented further down the road. 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The naviagtion bar appears on all three pages, the styling is identical across the site to provide familiarity to the user. The title of the website itself is a link to the landing page, a common choice that helps users find their way when lost. The bar is repsonsive, the page you are hovering over shall highlight a bright shade of yellow and appear underlined.
  - This feature allows users to comfortably and quickly navigate across the various pages, no matter their device type or current location.

- __Landing page video and text content__

  - This section shows some text either side of an iframe dispalying a video courtesy of the National Geogrpahic Youtube channel. The video is a snip from an episode of Ancient Aliens focusing on Gobekli Tepe. Either side of the video are boxes of text containing some more factual information sourced from online resources. 
  - The user will find this area valuable as it contians a broad range of information on Gobekli Tepe and introudces some theories and hypothesis surrounding the temples history. This may work well to capture the users interest. This video works well to introduce the Temple from a more 'alternative history' perspective, where as the text content is a more academic, factual resource. Providing both the hard facts and the fun.

- __First Call to Action__

  - The first call to action is a button that asks the user a rhetorical question, are they interested? If the answer is yes the user will click this button, at which point they will be taken to the articles page of the site, from this area they can research and potentially purchase a book.
  - This button has value in capturing the user, drawing them further into the site. If this site was built to receive some kind of commission via users purchasing a book through the links on the articles page, this would be a very important feature, enabling that commission stream. If this project was developed further, this call to action could take the user to our own online store.

- __Gallery of images__

  - The gallery area of the landing page acts almost as a 'Plan B' perhaps the user was interested in the initail content, but not particularly in the Gobekli Tepe Temple itself. Perhaps they are a student or teacher researching the topic of Ancient Temples. Well Gobekli Tepe was a great place to start, being the oldest known temple in the world. The gallery shows images of this temple giving users more context and encouraging their imaginations. Along with the images is a second Call-to-action button, which when clicked, shall navigate users to the timeline page of the website. On this page they can find addiitonal information and visual representations of the following 8 oldest temples in the world. Each icon on the timeline is an anchor that will open that temples relevant wikipedia page in a second tab.
  - As stated above, the images provide the usr with more context on the subject of focus, Gobekli Tepe. The images of both night and day, various angles and notable discoveries at the sight of Gobekli Tepe feed the users imagination as they begin to construct a mental-picture of the sight. This should draw them further into the content of the webpage, the call to action then locks on to this intrigue and directs it towards the timeline page. If this project was developed further, this timeline would work as an interective learning resource for students, teachers and amateur historians alike. From this area you can find some basic information on various temples and visual representations of them all, which act as links to the relevant wikipedia entries. These could be developed into links for various seperate webpages built into the website itself, featuring content similar to that of the landing page instead of directing the user away to a potential competitor. These seperate pages could have intergration with travel estores, allowing the user to search local holidays, flights and excursions at each of these historical sights. A additional opportunity to build in a commission stream of some kind.

- __The Footer__ 

  - In this section of the page, which is featured across the whole website, the user can find 3 useful links. A link that will load the wikipedia database of the oldest known buildings in the world, a link that will open the amazon store's search results for Gobekli Tepe and a final link that will load the youtube search results again for Gobekli Tepe. All three links open in a seperate tab and are designed to point the user in the direction of additional external resources.
  - The value in these links is that users can digest the content of the project, then be placed in some of the best locations to find additional information on the topic of focus, Gobeklit Tepe and ancient structures. Students and Teachers would find this section of most use, if the website was compared to a disseration, the footer would be the 'foot notes' providing the user with external resource to provide additional context to their understanding of the topic.

- __Timeline__

  - The timeline shows in order, images of the 8 oldest temples aside from Gobekli Tepe. The images will 'pop' when the viewer hovers their cursor over the image. This switch in appearance may prompt the viewer to click the image, opening a second window to the temples relevant wikipedia page for additonal reading. 
  - Users may find this area valuable should they wish to apply further context to their learning, or if the topic of ancient temples in general is of particular interest to them.

- __Articles__

  - This page features a grid of 8 tablets, each of these tablets features the image of a particular book relevant to Gobekli Tepe. Hovering the mouse over the image will make a slightly larger black box appear, with text content giving information on the book and a reference to purchasing the book online. Clicking the tablets will open a new browser window on an online store, such as amazon, where the user can purchase the book. 
  - Users may find this are valuable having viewed the content on the landing page and finding the topic of interest. Users can reach this page from the landing page, either through the navigation or through the 'Call to Action' button described above. This page allows users to find additional reading on the subject of Gobekli Tepe and enables the purchase of goods.

### Potential features to Implement

- Additional pages with detailed information and video relevant to the eight temples featured on the timeline. Link to those instead of pulling away from the site to wikipedia. 
- An interactive gallery/slideshow themed on each temple, linked to only via that temples relevant page. Or via a gallery dashboard page like a content hosting sight.
-Intergration with online stores to streamline the purchase process for the books featured on articles.html.
